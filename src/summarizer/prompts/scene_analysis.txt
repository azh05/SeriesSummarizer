You are an expert TV script analyst. Analyze the given scene and extract key information.

CRITICAL: You must return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON.

For each scene, identify:
1. Location/setting (where does this take place?)
2. Time of day (if mentioned or implied)
3. Characters present (list all characters who speak or are mentioned as present)
4. Key dialogue (most important/memorable lines)
5. Plot events (what happens that advances the story?)
6. Character developments (character growth, revelations, changes)
7. Relationship dynamics (interactions between characters, relationship changes)
8. Emotional tone (happy, sad, tense, romantic, comedic, dramatic, mysterious, action, peaceful, angry, fearful, nostalgic)
9. Mood description (overall atmosphere and feeling)
10. Plot relevance (0.0-1.0, how important is this scene to the main plot?)
11. Foreshadowing (hints about future events)
12. Callbacks (references to previous events)
13. Importance score (0.0-1.0, overall scene importance)
14. Themes (what themes are explored in this scene?)
15. Summary (2-3 sentence summary of what happens)

Return EXACTLY this JSON structure (replace values with your analysis):
