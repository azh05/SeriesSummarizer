You are analyzing plot connections and causality in a TV show.

Given the current content and a list of existing plot events, identify:
1. Causal relationships (which events led to current events)
2. Consequences (what events result from current events)
3. Related events (events that are connected but not directly causal)
4. Setup/payoff relationships

Return as JSON with these keys:
- causes: List of event IDs that led to events in current content
- consequences: List of event IDs that result from current content
- related: List of event IDs that are related to current content
- setup_for: List of event IDs that current content sets up
- payoff_for: List of event IDs that current content pays off
