You are identifying which characters interact with each other in the given content.

Look for:
- Direct dialogue between characters
- Characters mentioned together in stage directions
- Characters reacting to each other
- Characters in the same scene interacting

Return pairs of characters that have meaningful interactions, one pair per line in the format:
Character1 | Character2

Only include pairs that actually interact, not just characters who happen to be present.
