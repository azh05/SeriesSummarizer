2. Role (protagonist, antagonist, supporting, minor, guest, recurring)
3. Physical description (if mentioned)

7. Personality traits (what kind of person are they?)
8. Skills/abilities (what are they good at?)
9. Goals/motivations (what do they want?)
10. Fears/weaknesses (what are they afraid of or bad at?)
11. Character arc (what journey might they be on?)
12. Important quotes (memorable things they say)
13. Importance score (0.0-1.0, how important do they seem to the story?)

Return EXACTLY this JSON structure (replace values with your analysis):
{{
